# Alto - Value Sharing Platform for Creators

Alto is our submission for the **TikTok Value Sharing Challenge**.  
It is a **creator-centric system** designed to make value sharing transparent, explainable, and fair.  Alto fairly rewards creators with credits (called Nanas) per video based on transparent, tamper-resistant quality & impact scores, normalized by content category and creator size, with basic AML/fraud controls for cash-out.

## Value Flow

**Viewer actions (watch, like, comment, share) + AI content/quality assessment ‚Üí Score ‚Üí Credits minted to creator's Alto wallet ‚Üí Creator cashes out (KYC threshold) or spends in-app (gift cards / sponsorship slots).**

We log everything to an append-only ledger for auditability.

# Backend: TikTok Video Processing Pipeline

## üìä TikTok Video Processing Pipeline for **Evaluation** and **Compliance**

The backend evaluates TikTok videos for content quality, originality, engagement potential, and compliance using Google's Gemini models.
It outputs a structured JSON report for each video and computes a **reward tier** and **payout recommendation**.
It is recommended to use the `gemini-2.5-flash` model in production for better accuracy and reliability, and the `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` model in development for fast and low-cost testing.

## üöÄ Features
