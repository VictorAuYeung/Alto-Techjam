# Alto - Value Sharing Platform for Creators

Alto is our submission for the **TikTok Value Sharing Challenge**.  
It is a **creator-centric system** designed to make value sharing transparent, explainable, and fair.  Alto fairly rewards creators with credits (called Nanas) per video based on transparent, tamper-resistant quality & impact scores, normalized by content category and creator size, with basic AML/fraud controls for cash-out.

Unlike existing approaches that reward only virality or raw view counts, Alto combines:
- A **Frontend Dashboard** that lets creators register content and see their scores, credits, and compliance results.
- A **Backend Pipeline** powered by **Google Gemini** and our **Quality Scoring Engine (QSE)**, which evaluates videos across retention, engagement, niche fit, and authenticity.
- A **Compliance Layer** that flags risks like fraud, misinformation, or inappropriate content.

---

## ‚ú® Overview & Design Decisions

- **Why creator-first?**  
  Some of our team have creator backgrounds and know the frustration of working hard on meaningful content only to be overshadowed by quick viral trends. Alto was built to highlight *quality and authenticity* as much as *popularity*. 

- **In-app currency: Nanas üçå**  
  Instead of using fiat directly, Alto uses a **custom token called Nanas** (inspired by bananas).  
  - **Two-step redemption**: Views fund wallets in credits ‚Üí Nanas. Creators later redeem Nanas to real money. This extra layer prevents fraud and money laundering.  
  - **Variable value**: We envision the value of Nanas as **not fixed** ‚Äî it can inflate based on creator performance and quality scores, meaning high-value creators earn *more purchasing power per Nana*.  
  - **Auditability**: Every transfer of Nanas is logged in the transparent ledger, making the reward ecosystem tamper-evident and regulator-friendly.   

- **Explainability matters**  
  Instead of a ‚Äúblack box score,‚Äù Alto provides *reasons* behind each evaluation (e.g., ‚Äústrong retention, weak originality‚Äù). Creators can see what helps and hurts their rewards.  

- **Balance AI + heuristics**  
  We combined **Google Gemini** (for nuanced video analysis and compliance) with a lightweight **QSE heuristic** (Retention, Engagement, Niche, Authenticity) to keep results credible.  

- **Focus on fairness + compliance**  
  Compliance is not an afterthought ‚Äî every video is analyzed not just for quality, but also for **content safety and regulatory risks**.  
  Using Gemini models, the backend flags issues such as misinformation, financial scams, hate speech, age-inappropriate material, and other high-risk categories.  
  This ensures that only **safe and legitimate content** is rewarded with Nanas, while keeping the reward system transparent for both creators and reviewers.

- **Demo-first build**  
  To meet hackathon timelines, we included *preloaded demo content* and mock viewer events so judges can see results instantly.

**Value Flow**: Viewer actions (watch, like, comment, share) + AI content/quality assessment ‚Üí Score ‚Üí Credits minted to creator's Alto wallet ‚Üí Creator cashes out or spends in-app (gift cards / sponsorship slots).

# Backend: TikTok Video Processing Pipeline

## üìä TikTok Video Processing Pipeline for **Evaluation** and **Compliance**

The backend evaluates TikTok videos for content quality, originality, engagement potential, and compliance using Google's Gemini models.
It outputs a structured JSON report for each video and computes a **reward tier** and **payout recommendation**.
It is recommended to use the `gemini-2.5-flash` model in production for better accuracy and reliability, and the `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` model in development for fast and low-cost testing.

## üöÄ Features
